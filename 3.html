<h1>Astronaut in the ocean</h1>

Astro-naut
<br>What you know about rolling down in the deep?
<br>When your brain goes numb you can call that mental freeze
<br>When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
<br>I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ay

<br>I feel like an astronaut in the ocean
<br>She say that I'm cool, I'm like yeah that's true
<br>I believe in G-O-D, don't believe in T-H-O-T
<br>She keep playing me dumb
<br>I'ma play her for fun
<br>Y'all don't really know my mental
<br>Lemme give you the picture like stencil
<br>Fallin' out, in a drought, no flow, right words, I'm pouring down
<br>See that pain was all around, see my mode was kinda lounge
<br>Didn't know which which-way to turn
<br>Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
<br>Energy up, you can feel my surge
<br>I'ma kill everything like this purge
<br>Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work
<br>Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it
<br>Everything that I do is electric
<br>I'ma keep it inner motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ay
<br>Put this shit in a frame but I know I don't blame
<br>Every day that I say, "Man I seen you deflate"
<br>Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
<br>Have you woken on a plank, la-la-la-la-la
<br>Oh pass together, God let me party
<br>I've been going right, right around, caught a relay
<br>Pass the baton, back to the mall, swimming in the pool
<br>Can't drink 'em all, uh
<br>Wanna piece of this, a piece of mama, a piece of Xan
<br>Can you please read between the lines?
<br>My rhyme's inclined to break your spine
<br>They say that I'm so fine
<br>You could never match my crime
<br>Please do not now waste my time
